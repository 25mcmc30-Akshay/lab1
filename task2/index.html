  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a student with a strong interest in web development and modern
    technologies. Along with academics, I am passionate about cricket,
    chess, and singing. Cricket helps me stay active and develop teamwork
    skills, chess improves my logical thinking and problem-solving ability,
    and singing allows me to express creativity and relax my mind. I also
    enjoy reading books, as it enhances my knowledge and broadens my
    perspective. Geography is another subject that greatly interests me,
    especially learning about different countries, cultures, and physical
    landscapes. I love to travel whenever possible and explore new places,
    and I am also a foodie who enjoys trying different cuisines.
    <br><br>
    I belong to the land where people come seeking liberation and spiritual
    peace, Banaras, the sacred city known for Baba Vishwanath. It is a place
    where life and death coexist, and where the ghats continue to burn,
    reminding us of the real and harsh truth of life. Being born in such a
    spiritually rich and profound place makes me feel truly privileged, as
    it has deeply influenced my way of thinking and understanding of life.

        <h3>My Journey into Web Development</h3>
        <p>
      My journey into web development started with curiosity about how
      websites are created and how they work.<br> Learning HTML helped me
      understand the structure of web pages, while CSS taught me how to
      design and style them. This journey has motivated me to keep learning
      and improving my skills step by step.

        <h3>Importance of HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are the foundation of web development. HTML provides the
      basic structure of a website, whereas CSS is used to control layout,
      colors, fonts, and responsiveness. Together, they help in creating
      user-friendly and visually appealing websites.
